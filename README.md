This project consists of a fairly simple desktop application that functions as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a much larger idea. Which consists of building an open database of georeferenced data on the distribution of the species and possible threatened areas

The application currently features automatic detection of the Green Iguana species through computer vision using a YoloV8 convolutional neural network trained with its own dataset. The application also includes the ability to georeference sightings of the species on an interactive map.

This application was developed for the UTP 2025 Scientific Initiation Conference (Jornada de Iniciacion Cientifica UTP 2025) as a project in the Social Sciences and Humanities (Ciencia Sociales y Humanistica) category, combining artificial intelligence, software development, and artificial intelligence.

The project served as a new experience for me, a source of knowledge, and practice. It won't end here. That's why I'll call it the first version of the app. I have many future goals for this project:
- Improve the graphical interface
- Set up a central database for sightings
- Apply different forms of data analysis and prediction models

I would also like the project to serve as a unique practice for my data skills
